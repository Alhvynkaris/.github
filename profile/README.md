# hi, and welcome to Project Alhvynkaris!
Hello! Welcome to Project Alhvynkaris: a nonfiction-in-fiction, wide *and* as deep as an ocean, hard worldbuilding project wherein we do *NOT* break the laws of physics—we only add more and have the characters break it for us with an overly complicated magic system.

It gets nerdier every day, and we need your help to patch up our overly complex magic system, to make our map based on simulated tectonic history, culture, [conlangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language), culture based on flora and fauna and more…

Our main repositories are [Project Alhvynkaris](https://github.com/Alhvynkaris/Project-Alhvynkaris) itself, and our image/audio/other-large-files [Assets](https://github.com/Alhvynkaris/Assets) repository.

## please help.

This project is MEANT TO BE READ ON [OBSIDIAN](https://obsidian.md/download)! Obsidian is a free and offline markdown reader available on [Linux](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/releases/download/v1.10.3/Obsidian-1.10.3.AppImage), [Windows](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/releases/download/v1.10.3/Obsidian-1.10.3.exe), [Mac](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/releases/download/v1.10.3/Obsidian-1.10.3.dmg), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/obsidian-connected-notes/id1557175442), and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=md.obsidian).

To get started, simply clone the [main repository](https://github.com/Alhvynkaris/Project-Alhvynkaris), run Obsidian on it, and start writing! Since you're here, you probably know how to use `git`, but just in case this project gets so big that non-git users get into it, feel free to ask around the Discord server for help.

If you want to get verified for push requests and send us every picture of your pet cat(s), visit our Discord at [MAKE THE SERVER, WILT!!!!]

In the project’s current state, the repositories are generally closed off while I (wilt_r) write in the initial premise and structure. Once its done, you can help contribute to solve plot holes, add more features, and maybe, just maybe, we can figure out geojson together like real gis technicians >:O

###### i fear geojson like nothing else

However you help us, thank you so much for your contributions to make this… *overly* ambitious project come true!
